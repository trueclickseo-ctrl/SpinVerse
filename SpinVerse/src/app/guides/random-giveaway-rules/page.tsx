                1. Sweepstakes vs. Contests vs. Lotteries
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4 font-sans text-base leading-relaxed text-retro-navy/90 dark:text-cream/90">
                <p>
                  To run a promotional giveaway, you must understand how local and international laws categorize your event. Legally, promotions are divided into three distinct buckets: sweepstakes, contests, and lotteries. A lottery is strictly regulated, and in almost all jurisdictions, running a private lottery without a state license is illegal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A promotion is classified as a lottery if it contains all three of the following elements:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Prize:</strong> An item of value awarded to a winner.</li>
                  <li><strong>Chance:</strong> The winner is selected purely by random selection (e.g., spinning a wheel, rolling dice, drawing a name).</li>
                  <li><strong>Consideration:</strong> A payment, purchase, or substantial effort required from the participant to enter.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  To stay compliant, you must remove at least one of these three elements:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to create a Sweepstakes (Remove Consideration):</strong> Keep the prize and the element of chance, but remove any entry fee or purchase requirement. This is the origin of the mandatory phrase: <em>&quot;No Purchase Necessary to Enter or Win.&quot;</em> Anyone must be able to enter for free.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to create a Contest (Remove Chance):</strong> Keep the prize and the entry requirement (if desired), but remove chance. Instead of a random draw, the winner must be selected by judges based on skill, merit, or creative effort.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you are hosting a giveaway on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, or Facebook, you must also adhere to their specific terms of service. Failure to comply can result in account suspension or post-removal.
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Instagram & Facebook:</strong> You must include a complete release of Instagram/Facebook by each entrant and acknowledge that the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed, or administered by the platform. You cannot encourage users to inaccurately tag friends in photos.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube requires you to display clear rules, state that entries must comply with community guidelines, and provide a link to your official terms. You must not manipulate metrics (e.g., views, likes, or subscriber counts) as part of entry criteria.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>TikTok:</strong> Similar to Instagram, you must release TikTok of liability, publish clear rules, and ensure your sweepstakes does not violate local gambling regulations.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Once your entries are collected, you must draw a winner fairly. Picking a winner behind closed doors can lead to accusations of favoritism or fraud. To prevent this, many brands stream their draws live or upload screen recordings of the selection process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using a digital randomizer tool like the <Link href="/wheel-of-names" className="font-bold underline hover:text-retro-orange">Wheel of Names</Link> provides a clear, visual validation of fairness. You simply paste your list of entrants, click spin, and let the unbiased browser-side algorithm choose the winner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ensure you record the screen or host a live stream during the draw. This provides a transparent audit trail, protecting your reputation and reassuring your community that the winner was selected fairly.

                  Before launching, publish a simple document or landing page containing your official rules. Here is a checklist of what to include:
                </p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Eligibility requirements:</strong> State who can enter (e.g., minimum age, geographic restrictions).</li>
                  <li><strong>Entry periods:</strong> Clearly list the exact start and end dates/times, including timezone.</li>
                  <li><strong>Description of prizes:</strong> Describe the prize and its approximate retail value.</li>
                  <li><strong>How winner is selected:</strong> State that the winner will be drawn at random (e.g., using SpinVerse).</li>
                  <li><strong>How winners are notified:</strong> Detail the method of contact (e.g., email, DM) and how long they have to claim their prize before a redraw occurs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  By taking these steps, you protect your business legally while building credibility and trust with your online community.
