          </h2>
          <p className="font-medium text-base leading-relaxed">
            SpinVerse was born out of a desire to cure decision paralysis with high-fidelity, highly accessible, and visually stunning digital utility tools. We believe that choosing who goes first in a game, what to eat for lunch, or drawing a raffle ticket should feel interactive and engaging.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base leading-relaxed">
            By building a lightweight, zero-database application that runs entirely client-side, we protect user privacy and deliver blazing-fast page loads. No sign-ups required. No hidden fees.
          </p>

            <Heart className="text-retro-orange w-6 h-6" /> Built for Everyone
          </h2>
          <p className="font-medium text-base leading-relaxed">
            Teachers use our tools to choose students randomly, organizations use them to pick presenters, and groups of friends use them to decide on local hangouts. Whatever your decision is, we hope SpinVerse brings a bit of ease and playfulness to your process.
